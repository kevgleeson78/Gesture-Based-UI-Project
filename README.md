# Gesture-Based-UI-Project
This project is a 4th year assignment for the module Gesture Based UI Development.
## Overview
I have chose to develop a blackjack game using unity and google cardboard.
The player controls the game via head movements nodding yes for twist and no for stick.

Once the game has been completed win or loose a message is displayed to the user and an option is presented to the user to play again.

The option to play again is in the form of a button in the users view that can be activated via gaze input.
When the user points the reticle at the button for more than 1 second it will create a click event to restart the game.


### Initial ideas.

For this module we were given an open ended project to complete.
The choice of language weas up to us to choose along with the type to gesture control to use.
