# Gesture-Based-UI-Project
This project is a 4th year assignment for the module Gesture Based UI Development.
## Overview
For this module we were given an open ended project that integrates gesture based user interatcion with an application.
Uisng voice commands hand or head gestures to control an object via a software framework.
The choice of programming language and hardware was up to us to choose along with the type to gesture control to imnplement.

I have chosen to develop a blackjack game in VR using head guestures, unity, google cardboard and my android phone.
The player controls the game via head movements nodding yes or no to choose between the options available to the user.
The two options are Stick (nod no) or twist (nod yes).

Once the game has been completed (win or loose) a message is displayed to the user along with an option to play again.

The option to play again is in the form of a button in the users view that can be activated via gaze input.
When the user points the reticle at the button for more than 1 second it will create a click event to restart the game.

However before I came to decide on developing this system there were other ideas that were considered.


### Initial ideas.

The first idea I had was to develop a 3D game that controls a game object via a mobile phone accellerometer. 

This user would controll the object via hand gestures of:
Tilt Left: move left.
Tilt Right: move right.
Tilt Up: Move forward.
Tilt down: Move backwards.

The players game object would have to collect certain shapes to gain a positive score.
There woulsd also be certain shapes that would have a negative impact on the players score.

The objects that the player would collect and avoid would be dropped into the playing area for interaction.
In researching this proposal i had my phone dispalying the accellorometer and gyroscope data along with moving a basic game objest in a 3d environment.

However there was a issue with the data being processed by my phone specific to my model and an alternative proposal was needed for this project.
Here is an article on unity forums explaining the problem [Link Here](https://answers.unity.com/questions/1273323/gyroscope-samsung-s7-doesnt-work-properly.html).

### New Plan
After researching what my model of phone was capable of for gesture bsed development I foud Google Cardboard was a possibility.
I had a talk with my lecturer Damien Costello and we discussed VR and head gestures controlling a card game.
From this conversation I had the idea of creating a blackjack game that would be controlled by head guestures.

In the sections below I will discuss how I went about developing the game along with implementing the head gesture recognition for the system.

### Purpose of the application

### Gestures identified as appropriate for this application

### Hardware used in creating the application

### Architecture for the solution

### Conclusions & Recommendations
